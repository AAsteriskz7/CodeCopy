# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

## Required Icons

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows computers often use this size)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Requirements

- **Theme**: Copy/clipboard icon with modern, clean design
- **Colors**: Use a blue/purple gradient theme matching the extension popup
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Style**: Minimalistic, professional, easily recognizable at small sizes

## Suggested Design

The icon should represent copying code blocks, possibly combining:
- A clipboard or copy symbol
- Code brackets or code-like elements
- Clean, modern styling that works at all sizes

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator
- Online icon generators
- AI image generation tools
- Icon libraries (with proper licensing)

## Temporary Solution

For development and testing, you can use simple placeholder icons or convert the SVG from the popup header into PNG format at the required sizes.
